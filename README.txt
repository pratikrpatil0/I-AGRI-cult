# Our App: I AGRIcult Features and Limitations

===========================================================================

==> What we have:

-> Single file containing all functions, classes, and the main function.

-> Essential functionalities included: vectors, strings, etc.

-> Two interfaces: one for farmers and one for customers.

-> Printed crop names, prices, and stock for customers using an array (limited functionality due to time constraints).

-> Simple and minimal app due to challenges with connecting to a database and handling its complexity.

-> Hard-coded classes and values to achieve functionality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

==> What we don't have:

-> Login functionality for farmers and customers (deemed too complex for the current scope).
-> Dynamic functionality based on user interaction or data (limited due to database access challenges).
-> Complex logic for handling a full-fledged database.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

==> Future potential:

-> Expanding functionality to create a more dynamic app.
-> Integrating with a proper database for more advanced features.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

==> In short:

We've created a basic app with two interfaces and limited functionality due to time constraints and database challenges. We can expand upon this foundation in the future to create a more dynamic and feature-rich application.

==> HOW TO READ OUR APP:-

1. iagricult.cpp
2. Go to TERMINAL.
3. Go to the DIRECTORY where you saved the iagricult.cpp

5. COMMAND 2:- ./test
6. You will get welcome box and you have to choose 1 for farmer or 2 for 
customer
7. If you choose farmer, then you have to write username (e.g. farmer001 to  farmer050) and password (iagricult@123)
8. Then you will get the choices from 1 to 3, after choosing any of these you will get the choice for the stats which you are looking for,  you have to type 1 to access the stats which you are looking for.
9. after pressing 1 it will again ask your USERNAME, make sure you will type your username which you typed before and then you will get your data.
10. Program will get terminated.

7. If you choose customer, then you have to write username (e.g. customer001 to  customer050) and password (iagricult@123)
